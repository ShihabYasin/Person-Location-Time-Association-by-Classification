 Relation Extraction (spatial and temporal together, person-location-time ) from raw web news text in different languages(English, German, Hindi). Different Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning techniques were exercised. Feature Engineering was the most critical part that I designed common to all experimenting languages. Experimented with Support Vector Machines and later Ensemble Learning. Before that I designed a specialized annotation scheme to be applied on collected web data and finally collected in extensible markup language format for further application and improvement.
